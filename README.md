# Problem_Solving_challenges
A curated collection of algorithmic coding challenges implemented in Java. Focused on clean, readable, and optimized solutions to classic problems frequently found in technical interviews and competitive programming (e.g., HackerRank, LeetCode, Codeforces). Each solution includes detailed comments and complexity analysis.
✅ 1. Challenge: plusMinus
Problem
Given an array of integers, calculate the ratios of its elements that are:

Positive

Negative

Zero

Print each ratio on a new line with 6 decimal places.

Your Constraints
Use double for precision.

Avoid returning values; just print them.

No unnecessary loops.

✅ 2. Challenge: miniMaxSum
Problem
Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.

Your Constraints
Avoid loops by sorting.

Use long to avoid overflow.

Print two space-separated values: minSum maxSum.
